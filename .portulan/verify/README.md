# Verify recipes

> The executable half of "done". Core defines the hierarchy — *it compiles < the tests pass < the
> behaviour was exercised* — and the Stop-gate contract that makes climbing it non-optional
> ([`../../core/operating/verification.md`](../../core/operating/verification.md)). A workspace supplies
> the recipes themselves, because what "green" means is a property of the repository.

## The recipes

Two, since milestone 2. Both are declared in [`../workspace.json`](../workspace.json), which is also
where the **default** is named — [`docs.sh`](docs.sh), the one the Stop-gate will run when nothing more
specific applies. Run either from anywhere in the tree:

```
./.portulan/verify/docs.sh
./.portulan/verify/json.sh
```

| Recipe | Covers | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| [`docs.sh`](docs.sh) — default | links · kernel budget · repo map | `bash`, `git`, POSIX text utilities |
| [`json.sh`](json.sh) | every tracked `.json` file parses | the above, plus `node` |

Exit `0` green · `1` red · `2` could not run — and that third code is why each recipe declares its needs
in the manifest rather than discovering them: a recipe that *could not run* must never be mistaken for
one that ran and passed.

`docs.sh` needs nothing beyond `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `wc`, `sort`, `dirname`, and `mktemp`, and that is
worth preserving — a recipe that needs a toolchain is a recipe that stops being run.

**Why `json.sh` breaks that rule, deliberately.** Milestone 2 introduced the first JSON this repository
*depends* on rather than merely carries, and well-formedness is a parser's judgement: bash can only
approximate it, and an approximation would pass files it does not understand — a false green, which is
worse than no check at all. So the dependency was accepted for one recipe rather than smuggled into the
default, and the cost is stated in [`../identity.md`](../identity.md) instead of left for someone to
discover on a machine without `node`.

**What `json.sh` does not do.** It does not validate the manifest against
[`../../spec/workspace.schema.json`](../../spec/workspace.schema.json), and it does not check that the
paths a manifest names exist. That is `doctor`, in the second milestone-2 session. Well-formed is a long
way from correct.

## Where this sits in the hierarchy — honestly

This repository still ships no product code — the product is the files — so there is nothing to compile
and no suite to pass. That puts these checks on the bottom rung, and the honest description is that they
exercise the *documents* the way a linter exercises source. The recipes themselves are the only
executable thing here, and nothing tests them; they are verified by being run, which is a weaker claim
than it sounds and is why the false red described under Provenance below was caught by hand rather than
by a harness.

Real tests join these — they do not replace them — when `doctor` arrives later in milestone 2 and the CLI
at milestone 7. The multiple-recipes-with-a-named-default shape those anticipated is already here as of
milestone 2, so the default now lives in [`../workspace.json`](../workspace.json) rather than in this
sentence.

Saying all this matters: a recipe that implies more coverage than it has makes every later green worth
less.

## What each check enforces, and why it is a rail

| Check | The rule | Why it is machinery rather than a reminder |
|---|---|---|
| `links` | Every relative Markdown link resolves. | The engine is a web of cross-references between doctrine, templates, personas, and skills — progressive disclosure *is* those links. A dead link in a framework about context engineering is a product defect, not a docs defect. |
| `kernel` | [`../../core/engine.md`](../../core/engine.md) stays within 60 lines. | The always-loaded layer is the scarcest thing the framework spends, and the budget is constitutional. A budget that lives only in prose is the first thing a busy session negotiates with. |
| `map` | Every top-level entry appears in the root `README.md` layout table. | Agent legibility: a repository whose own map omits directories teaches an agent a false shape of the ground. This one exists because that had already happened — see below. |
| `parse` | Every tracked `.json` file is well-formed. | From milestone 2 the repository's policy layer *is* JSON. A manifest that does not parse gates nothing, and it fails at the moment it is needed rather than when it is written. |

## Provenance

The `map` check was added in milestone 1, session 3, after a fresh-context supervisor noticed that
`.claude-plugin/` — the manifest that makes this repository a plugin marketplace — had been missing from
the root README's layout table since the repository was created. The check was written **before** the
fix, went red on two entries, and went green only once the table was corrected. Recorded as
[`../memory/readme-map-must-match-shape.md`](../memory/readme-map-must-match-shape.md).

That sequence is the doctrine's own loop — mistake → rule → rail, with the incident carried along so the
rule can be retired if it ever stops applying
([`../../core/operating/evolution.md`](../../core/operating/evolution.md)).

The `parse` check was written in milestone 2 **before** the JSON it guards, on the reasoning that a
schema shipped with nothing that even parses it sits below the bar this repository already holds its
Markdown to. It earned its keep immediately, and against itself: the first draft mis-indexed `node -e`'s
argument vector and reported a perfectly good file as malformed — a **false red**, the one outcome the
limits below say to avoid at any cost. The argument handling was removed rather than repaired (the file
list now arrives on stdin), and the red→green transcript is in
[`../handoffs/2026-07-25-workspace-definition-v1.md`](../handoffs/2026-07-25-workspace-definition-v1.md).
Worth recording because the lesson generalises past this check: a false red is not a milder failure than
a false green, it is the one that gets the whole recipe switched off.

## Known limits

- **Anchors are not checked.** A link to `file.md#section` verifies only that `file.md` exists. Checking
  fragments needs a heading parser, and the failure it would catch is milder than the one it would add:
  false reds train people to stop trusting the recipe.
- **External URLs are not fetched.** Deliberate. A verify recipe that needs the network fails for reasons
  unrelated to the change under test, and a flaky gate is worse than no gate.
- **Link targets are matched by the filesystem's rules, not GitHub's.** On a case-insensitive volume —
  the macOS default — the existence test accepts `Core/engine.md` for `core/engine.md`, so a wrong-case
  link passes locally and 404s once the repository is browsed on GitHub or cloned onto Linux. Resolving
  targets against `git ls-files` instead would close it; until then this is a known false green, recorded
  rather than left to be discovered.
- **Code spans are not treated as code.** The `links` check scans raw text, so it neither skips fenced
  blocks and inline spans nor looks inside them. That cuts both ways, and both were observed the same
  day: a path written as a code span is never validated (two dead pointers in the plan survived several
  reviews that way), and Markdown link *syntax* quoted inside a code span — while writing about this
  check — is treated as a real link and fails. Skipping spans needs a small parser; until then, write
  paths as links when you want them checked, and avoid quoting link syntax verbatim.
- **Nothing here checks prose quality**, and nothing can. Conditions 2–4 of [`../dod.md`](../dod.md) are
  human judgement and are meant to stay that way.
