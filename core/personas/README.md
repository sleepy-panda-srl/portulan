# core/personas/

A **persona** is a role an agent takes — implementer, reviewer, librarian — packaged as a **context
firewall**: its own attention window, its own memory, and a `tools:` allow-list that grants only what
the role needs. The parent loop fans work out to a persona and gets back a conclusion, not the persona's
whole transcript, so the parent's context budget stays clean. _(Provenance: HumanLayer — subagents as
context firewalls; Cognition — read-parallel / write-isolated.)_

## What a persona file carries

- **`tools:` allow-list** — default-deny; the role's least-privilege surface (see
  [`../operating/safety.md`](../operating/safety.md) and [`../operating/autonomy.md`](../operating/autonomy.md)).
- **Charter** — what the role is for, and just as importantly what it must *not* do.
- **Memory scope** — memory is per-agent; a reviewer's memory is not the implementer's (see
  [`../operating/memory.md`](../operating/memory.md)).
- **Read / write posture** — most personas read in parallel; writes are isolated to one place so two
  agents never clobber the same file.

## Status

**Milestone 1 — shape only.** This README fixes the persona contract so the doctrine docs and the kernel
have a real path to point at. The exemplar personas (implementer, reviewer, librarian) are authored in
the next M1 session, once the concept-coverage pass has run, and are formalized as plugin agents in
milestone 3.
